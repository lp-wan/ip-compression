  LPWAN Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and fragmentation for
                              IPv6 and UDP
               draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc-16

Abstract

   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
   framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation
   functionalities.  SCHC has been designed for Low Power Wide Area
   Networks (LPWAN).

   SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in both
   the LPWAN device and the network side.  This document defines a
   header compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP
   headers.

   This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism
   that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN
   technologies.  Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after
   SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still
   exceed the layer-2 maximum payload size.

   The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are
   independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are
   used.  This document defines generic functionalities and offers
   flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices.
   Technology-specific settings and choices are expected to be made in
   other documents.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)
   framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation
   functionalities.  SCHC has been designed for Low Power Wide Area
   Networks (LPWAN).

   Header compression is needed for efficient Internet connectivity to
   the node within an LPWAN network.  Some LPWAN networks properties can
   be exploited to get an efficient header compression:

   o  The network topology is star-oriented, which means that all
      packets between the same source-destination pair follow the same
      path.  For the needs of this document, the architecture can simply
      be described as Devices (Dev) exchanging information with LPWAN
      Application Servers (App) through a Network Gateway (NGW).

   o  Because devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to
      be compressed are known in advance.  Indeed, new applications
      cannot be easily installed in LPWAN devices, as they would in
      computers or smartphones.

   SCHC compression uses a context in which information about header
   fieds is stored.  This context is static: the values of the header
   fields do not change over time.  This avoids complex
   resynchronization mechanisms, that would be incompatible with LPWAN
   characteristics.  In most cases, a small context identifier is enough
   to represent the full IPv6/UDP headers.  The SCHC header compression
   mechanism is independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which
   it is used.

   LPWAN technologies impose some strict limitations on traffic.  For
   instance, devices are sleeping most of the time and may receive data
   during short periods of time after transmission to preserve battery.
   LPWAN technologies are also characterized by a greatly reduced data
   unit and/or payload size (see [RFC8376]).  However, some LPWAN
   technologies do not provide fragmentation functionality; to support
   the IPv6 MTU requirement of 1280 bytes [RFC8200], they require a
   fragmentation protocol at the adaptation layer below IPv6.
   Accordingly, this document defines an fragmentation/reassembly
   mechanism for LPWAN technologies to supports the IPv6 MTU.  Its
   implementation is optional.  If not interested, the reader can safely
   skip its description.

   This document defines generic functionality and offers flexibility
   with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices.  Technology-

   documents.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  LPWAN Architecture

   LPWAN technologies have similar network architectures but different
   terminologies.  Using the terminology defined in [RFC8376], we can
   identify different types of entities in a typical LPWAN network, see
   Figure 1:

   o Devices (Dev) are the end-devices or hosts (e.g. sensors,
   actuators, etc.).  There can be a very high density of devices per
   radio gateway.

   o The Radio Gateway (RGW), which is the end point of the constrained
   link.

   o The Network Gateway (NGW) is the interconnection node between the
   Radio Gateway and the Internet.

   o LPWAN-AAA Server, which controls the user authentication and the
   applications.

   o Application Server (App)

4.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology and acronyms used in this
   document.

   Note that the SCHC acronym is pronounced like "sheek" in English (or
   "chic" in French).  Therefore, this document writes "a SCHC Packet"
   instead of "an SCHC Packet".

   o  App: LPWAN Application.  An application sending/receiving IPv6
      packets to/from the Device.

   o  AppIID: Application Interface Identifier.  The IID that identifies
      the application server interface.

   o  Bi: Bidirectional.  Characterises a Rule Entry that applies to
      headers of packets travelling in either direction (Up and Dw, see
      this glossary).

   o  CDA: Compression/Decompression Action.  Describes the reciprocal
      pair of actions that are performed at the compressor to compress a
      header field and at the decompressor to recover the original
      header field value.

   o  Compression Residue.  The bits that need to be sent (beyond the
      Rule ID itself) after applying the SCHC compression over each
      header field.

   o  Context: A set of Rules used to compress/decompress headers.

   o  Dev: Device.  A node connected to an LPWAN.  A Dev SHOULD
      implement SCHC.

   o  DevIID: Device Interface Identifier.  The IID that identifies the
      Dev interface.

   o  DI: Direction Indicator.  This field tells which direction of
      packet travel (Up, Dw or Bi) a Rule applies to.  This allows for
      assymmetric processing.

   o  Dw: Downlink direction for compression/decompression in both
      sides, from SCHC C/D in the network to SCHC C/D in the Dev.

   o  Field Description.  A line in the Rule table.

   o  FID: Field Identifier.  This is an index to describe the header
      fields in a Rule.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   o  FL: Field Length is the length of the packet header field.  It is
      expressed in bits for header fields of fixed lengths or as a type
      (e.g. variable, token length, ...) for field lengths that are
      unknown at the time of Rule creation.  The length of a header
      field is defined in the corresponding protocol specification.

   o  FP: Field Position is a value that is used to identify the
      position where each instance of a field appears in the header.

   o  IID: Interface Identifier.  See the IPv6 addressing architecture
      [RFC7136]

   o  L2: Layer two.  The immediate lower layer SCHC interfaces with.
      It is provided by an underlying LPWAN technology.  It does not
      necessarily correspond to the OSI model definition of Layer 2.

   o  L2 Word: this is the minimum subdivision of payload data that the
      L2 will carry.  In most L2 technologies, the L2 Word is an octet.
      In bit-oriented radio technologies, the L2 Word might be a single
      bit.  The L2 Word size is assumed to be constant over time for
      each device.

   o  MO: Matching Operator.  An operator used to match a value
      contained in a header field with a value contained in a Rule.

   o  Padding (P).  Extra bits that may be appended by SCHC to a data
      unit that it passes to the underlying Layer 2 for transmission.
      SCHC itself operates on bits, not bytes, and does not have any
      alignment prerequisite.  See Section 9.

   o  Rule: A set of header field values.

   o  Rule entry: A column in a Rule that describes a parameter of the
      header field.

   o  Rule ID: An identifier for a Rule.  SCHC C/D on both sides share
      the same Rule ID for a given packet.  A set of Rule IDs are used
      to support SCHC F/R functionality.

   o  SCHC C/D: Static Context Header Compression Compressor/
      Decompressor.  A mechanism used on both sides, at the Dev and at
      the network, to achieve Compression/Decompression of headers.
      SCHC C/D uses Rules to perform compression and decompression.

   o  SCHC Packet: A packet (e.g. an IPv6 packet) whose header has been
      compressed as per the header compression mechanism defined in this
      document.  If the header compression process is unable to actually
      compress the packet header, the packet with the uncompressed

      header is still called a SCHC Packet (in this case, a Rule ID is
      used to indicate that the packet header has not been compressed).
      See Section 7 for more details.

   o  TV: Target value.  A value contained in a Rule that will be
      matched with the value of a header field.

   o  Up: Uplink direction for compression/decompression in both sides,
      from the Dev SCHC C/D to the network SCHC C/D.

   Additional terminology for the optional SCHC Fragmentation /
   Reassembly mechanism (SCHC F/R) is found in Section 8.2.

5.  SCHC overview

   SCHC can be characterized as an adaptation layer between IPv6 and the
   underlying LPWAN technology.  SCHC comprises two sublayers (i.e. the
   Compression sublayer and the Fragmentation sublayer), as shown in
   Figure 2.

                |      IPv6      |
             +- +----------------+
             |  |   Compression  |
       SCHC <   +----------------+
             |  |  Fragmentation |

                                technology

   As per this document, when a packet (e.g. an IPv6 packet) needs to be
   transmitted, header compression is first applied to the packet.  The
   resulting packet after header compression (whose header may or may
   not actually be smaller than that of the original packet) is called a
   SCHC Packet.  If the SCHC Packet neds to be fragmented by the
   optional SCHC Fragmentation, fragmentation is then applied to the
   SCHC Packet.  The SCHC Packet or the SCHC Fragments are then
   transmitted over the LPWAN.  The reciprocal operations take place at
   the receiver.  This process is illustrated in Figure 3.

5.1.  SCHC Packet format

   The SCHC Packet is composed of the Compressed Header followed by the
   payload from the original packet (see Figure 4).  The Compressed
   Header itself is composed of a Rule ID and a Compression Residue.
   The Compression Residue may be absent, see Section 7.  Both the Rule
   ID and the Compression Residue potentially have a variable size, and
   generally are not a mutiple of bytes in size.

5.2.  SCHC Fragmentation message formats

   The SCHC Fragment has the following format:

   | Rule ID + DTAG + W + FCN [+ MIC ] |   Partial  SCHC Packet  |
   +-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
   |        Fragment Header            |   Fragment  Payload     |
   +-----------------------------------+-------------------------+


                          Figure 5: SCHC Fragment

   The Fragment Header size is variable and depends on the Fragmentation
   parameters.  The Fragment payload contains a part of the SCHC Packet
   Compressed Header, a part of the SCHC Packet Payload or both.  Its
   size depends on the L2 MTU (see Section 8).

   The SCHC ACK has the following format:

   |Rule ID + DTag + W|
   +------------------+-------- ... ---------+
   |    ACK Header    |    encoded Bitmap    |
   +------------------+-------- ... ---------+


                            Figure 6: SCHC ACK

   The SCHC ACK Header and the encoded Bitmap both have variable size.

   SCHC Fragmentation messages are further described in Section 8.

                          Figure 7: Architecture

   SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R are located on both sides of the LPWAN
   transmission, i.e. on the Dev side and on the Network side.

   The operation in the Uplink direction is as follows.  The Device
   application uses IPv6 or IPv6/UDP protocols.  Before sending the
   packets, the Dev compresses their headers using SCHC C/D and, if the
   SCHC Packet resulting from the compression needs to be fragmented by
   SCHC, SCHC F/R is performed (see Section 8).  The resulting SCHC
   Fragments are sent to an LPWAN Radio Gateway (RG) which forwards them
   to a Network Gateway (NGW).  The NGW sends the data to a SCHC F/R for
   re-assembly (if needed) and then to the SCHC C/D for decompression.
   After decompression, the packet can be sent over the Internet to one
   or several LPWAN Application Servers (App).

   The SCHC F/R and C/D on the Network side can be located in the NGW,
   or somewhere else as long as a tunnel is established between them and
   the NGW.  Note that, for some LPWAN technologies, it MAY be suitable
   to locate the SCHC F/R functionality nearer the NGW, in order to
   better deal with time constraints of such technologies.

   The SCHC C/D and F/R on both sides MUST share the same set of Rules.

   The SCHC C/D and F/R process is symmetrical, therefore the
   description of the Downlink direction is symmetrical to the one
   above.

6.  Rule ID

   Rule IDs are identifiers used to select the correct context either
   for Compression/Decompression or for Fragmentation/Reassembly.

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   The size of the Rule IDs is not specified in this document, as it is
   implementation-specific and can vary according to the LPWAN
   technology and the number of Rules, among others.

   The Rule IDs are used:

   o  In the SCHC C/D context, to identify the Rule (i.e., the set of
      Field Descriptions) that is used to compress a packet header.

   o  At least one Rule ID MAY be allocated to tagging packets for which
      SCHC compression was not possible (no matching Rule was found).

   o  In SCHC F/R, to identify the specific modes and settings of SCHC
      Fragments being transmitted, and to identify the SCK ACKs,
      including their modes and settings.  Note that when F/R is used
      for both communication directions, at least two Rule ID values are
      therefore needed for F/R.

7.  Compression/Decompression

   Compression with SCHC is based on using context, i.e. a set of Rules
   to compress or decompress headers.  SCHC avoids context
   synchronization, which consumes considerable bandwidth in other
   header compression mechanisms such as RoHC [RFC5795].  Since the
   content of packets is highly predictable in LPWAN networks, static
   contexts MAY be stored beforehand to omit transmitting some
   information over the air.  The contexts MUST be stored at both ends,
   and they can be learned by a provisioning protocol or by out of band
   means, or they can be pre-provisioned.  The way the contexts are
   provisioned is out of the scope of this document.

7.1.  SCHC C/D Rules

   The main idea of the SCHC compression scheme is to transmit the Rule
   ID to the other end instead of sending known field values.  This Rule
   ID identifies a Rule that provides the closest match to the original
   packet values.  Hence, when a value is known by both ends, it is only
   necessary to send the corresponding Rule ID over the LPWAN network.
   The manner by which Rules are generated is out of the scope of this
   document.  The Rules MAY be changed at run-time but the mechanism is
   out of scope of this document.

   The context contains a list of Rules (see Figure 8).  Each Rule
   itself contains a list of Field Descriptions composed of a Field
   Identifier (FID), a Field Length (FL), a Field Position (FP), a
   Direction Indicator (DI), a Target Value (TV), a Matching Operator
   (MO) and a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA).

               Figure 8: A Compression/Decompression Context

   A Rule does not describe how to parse a packet header to find each
   field.  This MUST be known from the compressor/decompressor.  Rules
   only describe the compression/decompression behavior for each header
   field.  In a Rule, the Field Descriptions are listed in the order in
   which the fields appear in the packet header.

   A Rule also describes what Compression Residue is sent.  The
   Compression Residue is assembled by concatenating the residues for
   each field, in the order the Field Descriptions appear in the Rule.

   The Context describes the header fields and its values with the
   following entries:

   o  Field ID (FID) is a unique value to define the header field.

   o  Field Length (FL) represents the length of the field.  It can be
      either a fixed value (in bits) if the length is known when the
      Rule is created or a type if the length is variable.  The length
      of a header field is defined in the corresponding protocol
      specification.  The type defines the process to compute the
      length, its unit (bits, bytes,...) and the value to be sent before
      the Compression Residue.

   o  Field Position (FP): most often, a field only occurs once in a
      packet header.  Some fields may occur multiple times in a header.
      FP indicates which occurrence this Field Description applies to.
      The default value is 1 (first occurence).

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   o  A Direction Indicator (DI) indicates the packet direction(s) this
      Field Description applies to.  Three values are possible:

      *  UPLINK (Up): this Field Description is only applicable to
         packets sent by the Dev to the App,

      *  DOWNLINK (Dw): this Field Description is only applicable to
         packets sent from the App to the Dev,

      *  BIDIRECTIONAL (Bi): this Field Description is applicable to
         packets travelling both Up and Dw.

   o  Target Value (TV) is the value used to match against the packet
      header field.  The Target Value can be of any type (integer,
      strings, etc.).  It can be a single value or a more complex
      structure (array, list, etc.), such as a JSON or a CBOR structure.

   o  Matching Operator (MO) is the operator used to match the Field
      Value and the Target Value.  The Matching Operator may require
      some parameters.  MO is only used during the compression phase.
      The set of MOs defined in this document can be found in
      Section 7.4.

   o  Compression Decompression Action (CDA) describes the compression
      and decompression processes to be performed after the MO is
      applied.  Some CDAs MAY require parameter values for their
      operation.  CDAs are used in both the compression and the
      decompression functions.  The set of CDAs defined in this document
      can be found in Section 7.5.

7.2.  Rule ID for SCHC C/D

   Rule IDs are sent by the compression function in one side and are
   received for the decompression function in the other side.  In SCHC
   C/D, the Rule IDs are specific to a Dev. Hence, multiple Dev
   instances MAY use the same Rule ID to define different header
   compression contexts.  To identify the correct Rule ID, the SCHC C/D
   needs to associate the Rule ID with the Dev identifier to find the
   appropriate Rule to be applied.

7.3.  Packet processing

   The compression/decompression process follows several steps:

   o  Compression Rule selection: The goal is to identify which Rule(s)
      will be used to compress the packet's headers.  When performing
      decompression, on the network side the SCHC C/D needs to find the
      correct Rule based on the L2 address; in this way, it can use the



Minaburo, et al.         Expires March 16, 2019                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


      DevIID and the Rule ID.  On the Dev side, only the Rule ID is
      needed to identify the correct Rule since the Dev typically only
      holds Rules that apply to itself.  The Rule will be selected by
      matching the Fields Descriptions to the packet header as described
      below.  When the selection of a Rule is done, this Rule is used to
      compress the header.  The detailed steps for compression Rule
      selection are the following:

      *  The first step is to choose the Field Descriptions by their
         direction, using the Direction Indicator (DI).  A Field
         Description that does not correspond to the appropriate DI will
         be ignored.  If all the fields of the packet do not have a
         Field Description with the correct DI, the Rule is discarded
         and SCHC C/D proceeds to consider the next Rule.

      *  When the DI has matched, then the next step is to identify the
         fields according to Field Position (FP).  If FP does not
         correspond, the Rule is not used and the SCHC C/D proceeds to
         consider the next Rule.

      *  Once the DI and the FP correspond to the header information,
         each packet field's value is then compared to the corresponding
         Target Value (TV) stored in the Rule for that specific field
         using the matching operator (MO).

         If all the fields in the packet's header satisfy all the
         matching operators (MO) of a Rule (i.e. all MO results are
         True), the fields of the header are then compressed according
         to the Compression/Decompression Actions (CDAs) and a
         compressed header (with possibly a Compression Residue) SHOULD
         be obtained.  Otherwise, the next Rule is tested.

      *  If no eligible Rule is found, then the header MUST be sent
         without compression (but may require the use of the SCHC F/R
         process).

   o  Sending: If an eligible Rule is found, the Rule ID is sent to the
      other end followed by the Compression Residue (which could be
      empty) and directly followed by the payload.  The Compression
      Residue is the concatenation of the Compression Residues for each
      field according to the CDAs for that Rule.  The way the Rule ID is
      sent depends on the specific underlying LPWAN technology.  For
      example, it can be either included in an L2 header or sent in the
      first byte of the L2 payload. (see Figure 9).  This process will
      be specified in the LPWAN technology-specific document and is out
      of the scope of the present document.  On LPWAN technologies that
      are byte-oriented, the compressed header concatenated with the




Minaburo, et al.         Expires March 16, 2019                [Page 15]

      original packet payload is padded to a multiple of 8 bits, if
      needed.  See Section 9 for details.

   o  Decompression: When doing decompression, on the network side the
      SCHC C/D needs to find the correct Rule based on the L2 address
      and in this way, it can use the DevIID and the Rule ID.  On the
      Dev side, only the Rule ID is needed to identify the correct Rule
      since the Dev only holds Rules that apply to itself.

      The receiver identifies the sender through its device-id or source
      identifier (e.g.  MAC address, if it exists) and selects the Rule
      using the Rule ID.  This Rule describes the compressed header
      format and associates the values to the header fields.  The
      receiver applies the CDA action to reconstruct the original header
      fields.  The CDA application order can be different from the order
      given by the Rule.  For instance, Compute-* SHOULD be applied at
      the end, after all the other CDAs.

7.4.  Matching operators

   Matching Operators (MOs) are functions used by both SCHC C/D
   endpoints involved in the header compression/decompression.  They are
   not typed and can be applied to integer, string or any other data
   type.  The result of the operation can either be True or False.  MOs
   are defined as follows:

   o  equal: The match result is True if the field value in the packet
      matches the TV.

   o  ignore: No check is done between the field value in the packet and
      the TV in the Rule.  The result of the matching is always true.

   o  MSB(x): A match is obtained if the most significant x bits of the
      packet header field value are equal to the TV in the Rule.  The x
      parameter of the MSB MO indicates how many bits are involved in
      the comparison.  If the FL is described as variable, the length
      must be a multiple of the unit.  For example, x must be multiple
      of 8 if the unit of the variable length is in bytes.

   o  match-mapping: With match-mapping, the Target Value is a list of
      values.  Each value of the list is identified by a short ID (or
      index).  Compression is achieved by sending the index instead of
      the original header field value.  This operator matches if the
      header field value is equal to one of the values in the target
      list.

7.5.  Compression Decompression Actions (CDA)

   The Compression Decompression Action (CDA) describes the actions
   taken during the compression of headers fields, and inversely, the
   action taken by the decompressor to restore the original value.

   /--------------------+-------------+----------------------------\
   |  Action            | Compression | Decompression              |

   The second and third columns show the reciprocal compression/

   Compression is done in the order that the Field Descriptions appear

   o  If the size is between 0 and 14, it is sent as a 4-bits unsigned
      integer.

   o  For values between 15 and 254, 0b1111 is transmitted and then the
      size is sent as an 8 bits unsigned integer.

   o  For larger values of the size, 0xffff is transmitted and then the
      next two bytes contain the size value as a 16 bits unsigned
      integer.

   If a field is not present in the packet but exists in the Rule and
   its FL is specified as being variable, size 0 MUST be sent to denote
   its absence.

7.5.2.  not-sent CDA

   The not-sent action is generally used when the field value is
   specified in a Rule and therefore known by both the Compressor and
   the Decompressor.  This action SHOULD be used with the "equal" MO.
   If MO is "ignore", there is a risk to have a decompressed field value
   different from the original field that was compressed.

   The compressor does not send any Compression Residue for a field on
   which not-sent compression is applied.

   The decompressor restores the field value with the Target Value
   stored in the matched Rule identified by the received Rule ID.

7.5.3.  value-sent CDA

   The value-sent action is generally used when the field value is not
   known by both the Compressor and the Decompressor.  The value is sent
   as a residue in the compressed message header.  Both Compressor and
   Decompressor MUST know the size of the field, either implicitly (the
   size is known by both sides) or by explicitly indicating the length
   in the Compression Residue, as defined in Section 7.5.1.  This action
   is generally used with the "ignore" MO.

7.5.4.  mapping-sent CDA

   The mapping-sent action is used to send an index (the index into the
   Target Value list of values) instead of the original value.  This
   action is used together with the "match-mapping" MO.

   On the compressor side, the match-mapping Matching Operator searches
   the TV for a match with the header field value and the mapping-sent
   CDA appends the corresponding index to the Compression Residue to be

   sent.  On the decompressor side, the CDA uses the received index to
   restore the field value by looking up the list in the TV.

   The number of bits sent is the minimal size for coding all the
   possible indices.

7.5.5.  LSB CDA

   The LSB action is used together with the "MSB(x)" MO to avoid sending
   the most significant part of the packet field if that part is already
   known by the receiving end.  The number of bits sent is the original
   header field length minus the length specified in the MSB(x) MO.

   The compressor sends the Least Significant Bits (e.g.  LSB of the
   length field).  The decompressor concatenates the x most significant
   bits of Target Value and the received residue.

   If this action needs to be done on a variable length field, the size
   of the Compression Residue in bytes MUST be sent as described in
   Section 7.5.1.

7.5.6.  DevIID, AppIID CDA

   These actions are used to process respectively the Dev and the App
   Interface Identifiers (DevIID and AppIID) of the IPv6 addresses.
   AppIID CDA is less common since most current LPWAN technologies
   frames contain a single L2 address, which is the Dev's address.

   The IID value MAY be computed from the Device ID present in the L2
   header, or from some other stable identifier.  The computation is
   specific to each LPWAN technology and MAY depend on the Device ID
   size.

   In the downlink direction (Dw), at the compressor, the DevIID CDA may
   be used to generate the L2 addresses on the LPWAN, based on the
   packet's Destination Address.

7.5.7.  Compute-*

   Some fields may be elided during compression and reconstructed during
   decompression.  This is the case for length and checksum, so:

   o  compute-length: computes the length assigned to this field.  This
      CDA MAY be used to compute IPv6 length or UDP length.

   o  compute-checksum: computes a checksum from the information already
      received by the SCHC C/D.  This field MAY be used to compute UDP
      checksum.

8.  Fragmentation/Reassembly

8.1.  Overview

   In LPWAN technologies, the L2 MTU typically ranges from tens to
   hundreds of bytes.  Some of these technologies do not have an
   internal fragmentation/reassembly mechanism.

   The SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly (SCHC F/R) functionality is offered
   as an option for such LPWAN technologies to cope with the IPv6 MTU
   requirement of 1280 bytes [RFC8200].  It is optional to implement.
   If it is not needed, its description can be safely ignored.

   It has been designed under the following assumptions

   o  Data unit out-of-sequence delivery does not occur between the
      entity performing fragmentation and the entity performing
      reassembly

   o  The L2 MTU value does not change while a fragmented SCHC Packet is
      being transmitted.

   These assumptions allow reducing the complexity and overhead of the
   SCHC F/R mechanism.

   This specification includes several SCHC F/R modes, which allow for a
   range of reliability options such as optional SCHC Fragment
   retransmission.  More modes may be defined in the future.  The same
   SCHC F/R mode MUST be used for all SCHC Fragments of a fragmented
   SCHC Packet.  This document does not make any decision with regard to
   which mode(s) will be used over a specific LPWAN technology.  This
   will be defined in other technology-specific documents.

   SCHC F/R uses the knowledge of the L2 Word size (see Section 4) to
   encode some messages.  Therefore, SCHC MUST know the L2 Word size.
   SCHC F/R usually generates SCHC Fragments and SCHC ACKs that are
   multiples of L2 Words.  The padding overhead is kept to the absolute
   minimum (see Section 9).

8.2.  SCHC F/R Tools

   This subsection describes the different tools that are used to enable
   the SCHC F/R functionality defined in this document.  These tools
   include the SCHC F/R messages, windows, timers and header fields.

   The tools are described here in a generic manner.  Their application
   to each SCHC F/R mode is found in Section 8.4.

8.2.1.  Messages

   The messages that can be used by SCHC F/R are the following

   o  SCHC Fragment: A data unit that carries a subset of a SCHC Packet
      from the sender to the receiver.

   o  SCHC ACK: An acknowledgement for fragmentation.  This message is
      used by the receiver to report to the sender on the success of
      reception of a set of SCHC Fragments.

   o  SCHC ACK REQ: A request for a SCHC ACK.  It can be used when the
      sender expects a SCHC ACK from the receiver but doesn't receive
      one.

   o  SCHC Sender-Abort: A message by the sender telling the receiver
      that it has aborted the transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet.

   o  SCHC Receiver-Abort: A message by the receiver to tell the sender
      to abort the transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet.

8.2.2.  Windows, Timers, Counters

   Some SCHC F/R modes may handle SCHC Fragments as collections, called
   windows.  When windowing is used, information on the correct
   reception of the SCHC Fragments belonging to a window is grouped
   together and may be sent back as a SCK ACK.  Whatever the windowing
   choice, a SCHC ACK may report on the reception of all the SCHC
   Fragments composing a fragmented SCHC Packet.

   Some SCHC F/R modes can use the following timers and counters

   o  Inactivity Timer: this timer can be used to unlock a SCHC Fragment
      receiver that is not receiving a SCHC F/R message while it is
      expecting one.

   o  Retransmission Timer: this timer can be used by a SCHC Fragment
      sender to set a timeout on expecting a SCHC ACK.

   o  Attempts: this counter counts the requests for a missing SCHC ACK.
      MAX_ACK_REQUESTS is the threshold at which the SCHC Fragment
      sender stops sending requests.

8.2.3.  Header Fields

   The SCHC F/R messages use the following fields (see the related
   formats in Section 8.3)




Minaburo, et al.         Expires March 16, 2019                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   o  Rule ID: this is used to identify

      *  that a SCHC F/R message is being carried, as opposed to an
         unfragmented SCHC Packet,

      *  which SCHC F/R mode is used

      *  and among this mode

         +  if windowing is used, what the window size is

         +  what optional fields are present

         +  and what the field sizes are.

      Therefore, the Rule ID allows SCHC F/R interleaving non-fragmented
      SCHC Packets and SCHC Fragments that carry other SCHC Packets, or
      interleaving SCHC Fragments that use different SCHC F/R modes or
      different parameters.

   o  Fragment Compressed Number (FCN).  The FCN is present in the SCHC
      Fragments header.  This field conveys information about the
      progress in the sequence of SCHC Fragments.  For exemple, it can
      contain a truncated, efficient representation of a larger-sized
      fragment number.  The exact use of the FCN field is left to each
      SCHC F/R mode.  However, two values are special.  They help
      control the SCHC F/R process:

      *  The FCN value with all the bits equal to 1 (All-1) signals the
         very last SCHC Fragment of a SCHC Packet.  By extension, if
         windowing is used, the last window of a packet is called the
         All-1 window.

      *  If windowing is used, the FCN value with all the bits equal to
         0 (All-0) signals the last SCHC Fragment of a window that is
         not the last one of the SCHC packet.  By extension, such a
         window is called an All-0 window.

      The size of the FCN field is called N.  It is defined for each F/R
      mode and Rule Id.  Since All-1 is special, the maximum value of
      FCN (as an unsigned integer) theoretically is (2^N)-2.  However,
      each SCHC F/R mode or each LPWAN technology-specific document is
      free to specify a maximum value, called MAX_WIND_FCN, lower than
      (2^N)-2.  The rationale is that MAX_WIND_FCN finely controls the
      width of the Bitmap in the SCHC ACK message, which may be critical
      to some LPWAN technologies.

   o  Datagram Tag (DTag).  The DTag field is optional.



Minaburo, et al.         Expires March 16, 2019                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


      When there is no DTag, there can be only one fragmented SCHC
      Packet in transit: only after all its fragments have been
      transmitted can another fragmented SCHC Packet be sent.

      If present, DTag MUST be set to the same value for all SCHC
      Fragments carrying the same SCHC packet, and to different values
      for different SCHC Packets.  Using this field, the sender can
      interleave fragments from different SCHC Packets, while the
      receiver can still tell them apart.

      If a SCHC ACK message is sent, it MUST carry the same DTag value
      as the SCHC Fragments for which this SCHC ACK is intended.

      The presence and size of the DTag field is defined by each SCHC F/
      R mode for each Rule ID value.  For each new SCHC Packet processed
      by the sender under the same F/R mode and same RuleID, DTag MUST
      be sequentially increased, from 0 to (2^T) - 1 wrapping back from
      (2^T) - 1 to 0, where T is the size of DTag in bits.

   o  W (window): The W field is optional.  It is only present if
      windowing is used.

      This field carries the same value for all SCHC F/R messages
      pertaining to the same window, and it is incremented for the next
      window.  The value of W is initialised to 0 for each new SCHC
      Packet fragmented under the same F/R mode and Rule Id.

      The presence of W and its size (called M, in bits) is defined for
      each F/R mode and Rule Id.

   o  Message Integrity Check (MIC).  This field is optional.  If
      present, it only appears in the All-1 SCHC Fragments and in the
      All-1 ACK REQ.  If present, its size MUST be at least an L2 Word.
      If the MIC is present, the sender MUST compute it over the
      complete SCHC Packet and the potential padding bits of the last
      SCHC Fragment.

      The MIC allows the receiver to check for errors in the reassembled
      SCHC Packet.  It supports UDP checksum elision by SCHC C/D (see
      Section 10.11).

      The CRC32 polynomial 0xEDB88320 (i.e. the reverse representation
      of the polynomial used e.g. in the Ethernet standard [RFC3385]) is
      RECOMMENDED as the default algorithm for computing the MIC.
      Nevertheless, other MIC lengths or other algorithms MAY be
      required by the technology-specific documents.

      Note that the concatenation of the complete SCHC Packet and the
      potential padding bits of the last SCHC Fragment does not
      generally constitute an integer number of bytes.  For implementers
      to be able to used byte-oriented CRC libraries, it is RECOMMENDED
      that the concatenation of the complete SCHC Packet and the last
      fragment potential padding bits be zero-extended to the next byte
      boundary and that the MIC be computed on that byte array.

   o  C (MIC checked): C is a 1-bit field.  It is optional, and goes
      together with the use of the MIC field.  This field is used in the
      SCHC ACK packets to report the outcome of the MIC check, i.e.
      whether the fragmented SCHC Packet was correctly reassembled or
      not.  A value of 1 tells that the MIC computed by the receiver
      matches the MIC that was transmitted.  A value of 0 represents a
      mismatch.

   o  Bitmap.  The Bitmap is used together with windowing.  It is a bit
      field maintained by the sender during the fragmentation and by the
      receiver during the reassembly of a fragmented SCHC Packet.  The
      Bitmap may also be carried in a SCHC ACK, either in extenso or in
      a shortened form (see Section 8.3.2.3).  Each bit in the internal
      representation of the Bitmap corresponds to a SCHC Fragment of the
      current window, and provides feedback on whether the SCHC Fragment
      has been received or not.  The right-most position on the Bitmap
      reports if the All-0 or All-1 fragment has been correctly received
      or not.  Feedback on the SCHC Fragment with the FCN ==
      MAX_WIND_FCN value is provided by the bit in the left-most
      position of the Bitmap.  In the Bitmap, a bit set to 1 indicates
      that the SCHC Fragment of FCN corresponding to that bit position
      has been correctly received.

8.3.  SCHC F/R Message Formats

   This section defines the SCHC Fragment format, the SCHC ACK format,
   the SCHC ACK REQ format and the SCHC Abort formats.

8.3.1.  SCHC Fragment format

   A SCHC Fragment conforms to the general format shown in Figure 11.
   It comprises a SCHC Fragment Header and a SCHC Fragment Payload.  The
   SCHC Fragment Payload carries a subset of the SCHC Packet.  In
   addition, the last SCHC Fragment of a SCHC Packet carries just enough
   padding bits as needed to fill up an L2 Word.  The SCHC Fragment is
   the data unit passed on to the L2 for transmission.

   Figure 11: SCHC Fragment general format.  Presence of a padding field
                                is optional

8.3.1.1.  Fragments that are not the last one

   All SCHC Fragments except the last one of a SCHC Packet MUST conform
   to the detailed format defined in Figure 12.  The W field is
   optional.  Its presence is specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

    |------ Fragment Header ------|
              |-- T --|-M-|-- N --|
    +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+--------...-------+
    | Rule ID | DTag  | W |  FCN  | Fragment Payload |
    +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+--------...-------+


    Figure 12: Detailed Header Format for Fragments except the Last One

   The total size of the Fragment Header is not necessarily a multiple
   of the L2 Word size.  To build the Fragment Payload, SCHC F/R MUST
   take from the SCHC Packet a number of bits that makes the SCHC
   Fragment an exact multiple of L2 Words.  As a consequence, no padding
   bit is used for these fragments.

   The Fragment Payload of a SCHC Fragment with FCN == All-0 (called an
   All-0 SCHC Fragment) MUST be at least the size of an L2 Word.  The
   rationale is that, even in the presence of padding, an All-0 SCHC
   Fragment needs to be distinguishable from the SCHC ACK REQ message,
   which has the same header (see Section 8.3.3.1).

8.3.1.2.  All-1 SCHC Fragment

   The Fragment Header of the last SCHC Fragment of a SCHC Packet MUST
   conform to the detailed format shown in Figure 13.  The W field is
   optional.  Its presence is specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

     Figure 13: Detailed Header Format for the last SCHC Fragment of a
                                SCHC Packet

   The total size of the All-1 SCHC Fragment header is generally not a
   multiple of the L2 Word size.  The All-1 SCHC Fragment being the last
   one of the SCHC Packet, SCHC F/R cannot freely choose the payload
   size to align the fragment to an L2 Word.  Therefore, padding bits
   are generally appended to the All-1 SCHC Fragment to make it a
   multiple of L2 Words in size.

   The MIC MUST be computed on the payload and the padding bits.  The
   rationale is that the SCHC Reassembler needs to check the correctness
   of the reassembled SCHC packet but it has no way of knowing where the
   payload ends.  Indeed, the latter requires decompressing the SCHC
   Packet, which out of the scope of the reassembler.

   An All-1 SCHC Fragment payload MUST be at least the size of an L2
   Word.  The rationale is that, even in the presence of padding, the
   SCHC All-1 ACK REQ (see Section 8.3.3.2) needs to be distinguishable
   from the All-1 SCHC Fragment.  This may entail saving an L2 Word from
   the payload of the previous SCHC Fragment to make the payload of this
   All-1 SCHC Fragment big enough.

   The values for N, T and the length of MIC are not specified in this
   document, and SHOULD be determined in other documents (e.g.
   technology-specific profile documents).

8.3.2.  SCHC ACK format

8.3.2.1.  All-0 SCHC ACK

   This message only appears in SCHC F/R modes that use windowing.  The
   format of a SCHC ACK that acknowledges a window of SCHC Fragments
   that is not the last one of a SCHC Packet (All-0 window) is shown in
   Figure 14.

   The Rule ID and DTag values in the SCHC ACK message MUST be identical
   to the ones used in the SCHC Fragments that are being acknowledged.
   This allows matching the SCHC ACK and the corresponding SCHC
   Fragments.

8.3.2.2.  All-1 SCHC ACK

   The format of a SCHC ACK that follows the transmission of the last
   SCHC Fragments of a SCHC Packet is shown in Figure 15.  The W field
   is optional.  Its presence is specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

        Figure 15: Format of a SCHC ACK at the end of a SCHC Packet
                               transmission

   The All-1 SCHC ACK header contains a C bit (i.e.  MIC checked) to
   indicate if the MIC computed by the receiver matches the MIC
   transmitted in the All-1 SCHC Fragment.  If there is a match, the C
   bit is set to 1.  If the MICs don't match, the C bit is set to 0 and
   the Bitmap for the All-1 window follows.

   The Rule ID and DTag values in the SCHC ACK messages MUST be
   identical to the ones used in the SCHC Fragments that are being
   acknowledged.  This allows matching the SCHC ACK and the
   corresponding SCHC Fragments.

   The Bitmap carries information on the reception of each fragment of
   the window as described in Section 8.2.

   See Appendix D for a discussion on the size of the Bitmaps.

   In order to reduce the SCK ACK size, the Bitmap that is actually
   transmitted is shortened ("encoded") as explained in Section 8.3.2.3.

8.3.2.3.  Bitmap Encoding

   The SCHC ACK that is transmitted is truncated by applying the
   following algorithm: the longest contiguous sequence of bits that
   starts at an L2 Word boundary of the SCHC ACK, where the bits of that
   sequence are all set to 1, are all part of the Bitmap and finish
   exactly at the end of the Bitmap, if one such sequence exists, MUST
   NOT be transmitted.  Because the SCHC Fragment sender knows the
   actual Bitmap size, it can reconstruct the original Bitmap from the
   shortened bitmap.

   When shortening effectively takes place, the SCHC ACK is a multiple
   of L2 Words, and padding MUST NOT be appended.  When shortening does
   not happen, padding bits MUST be appended as needed to fill up the
   last L2 Word.

   Figure 16 shows an example where L2 Words are actually bytes and
   where the original Bitmap contains 17 bits, the last 15 of which are
   all set to 1.

   |--  SCHC ACK Header --|--------       Bitmap    --------|
   |  Rule ID  |  DTag  |W|1|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|
        next L2 Word boundary ->|  next L2 Word |  next L2 Word |

8.3.3.  SCHC ACK REQ format

8.3.3.1.  SCHC All-0 ACK REQ

   The SCHC All-0 ACK REQ is only used in SCHC F/R that use a windowing
   mechanism.  Its purpose is for a a sender to request the
   retransmission of a SCHC ACK by the receiver, at the end of a window
   which is not the last one of a SCHC Packet.  The SCHC All-0 ACK REQ
   format is described in Figure 20.  The W field is optional.  Its
   presence is specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

              Figure 20: All-0 empty fragment detailed format

   Notice that the SCHC All-0 ACK REQ has the same header as an All-0
   SCHC Fragment but doesn't have a a payload.  The message length
   allows distinguishing between a SCHC All-0 ACK REQ and a All-0 SCHC
   Fragment.

   The size of the SCHC All-0 ACK REQ header is generally not a multiple
   of the L2 Word size.  Therefore, a SCHC All-0 ACK REQ generally needs
   padding bits.  The padding bits are always less than an L2 Word.

   Since an All-0 SCHC Fragment payload MUST be at least the size of an
   L2 Word, a receiver can distinguish a SCHC All-0 ACK REQ from an
   All-0 SCHC Fragment, even in the presence of padding.

8.3.3.2.  SCHC All-1 ACK REQ

   The SCHC All-1 ACK REQ is used by a fragment sender to request a
   retransmission of the SCHC ACK after it has transmitted the last SCHC
   Fragment of a SCHC Packet.  It's format is described in Figure 21.
   The W field is optional.  Its presence is specified by each SCHC F/R
   mode.

  |---------- ACK REQ Header -----------|

       Figure 21: All-1 for Retries format, also called All-1 empty

   Notice that the SCHC All-1 ACK REQ has the same header as an All-1
   SCHC Fragment but doesn't have a a payload.  The message length
   allows distinguishing between a SCHC All-1 ACK REQ and a All-1 SCHC
   Fragment.

   The size of the SCHC All-1 ACK REQ header is generally not a multiple
   of the L2 Word size.  Therefore, a SCHC All-1 ACK REQ generally needs
   padding bits.  The padding bits are always less than an L2 Word.

   Since an All-1 SCHC Fragment payload MUST be at least the size of an
   L2 Word, a receiver can distinguish a SCHC All-1 ACK REQ from an
   All-1 SCHC Fragment, even in the presence of padding.

8.3.4.  SCHC Abort formats

8.3.4.1.  SCHC Sender-Abort

   When a SCHC Fragment sender needs to abort an on-going fragmented
   SCHC Packet transmission, it sends a SCHC Sender-Abort.  Its format
   is described in Figure 22.  The W field is optional.  Its presence is
   specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

   |------ Fragment Header ------|
             |-- T --|-M-|-- N --|
   +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   | Rule ID | DTag  | W | 11..1 | padding (as needed)
   +-- ... --+- ... -+---+- ... -+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                    Figure 22: SCHC Sender-Abort format

   Notice that the SCHC Sender-Abort has the same header as an All-1
   SCHC Fragment, but that it does not include a MIC nor a payload.  The
   message length allows distinguishing between a SCHC Sender-Abort and
   a SCHC Fragment.

   The size of the SCHC Sender-Abort header is generally not a multiple
   of the L2 Word size.  Therefore, a SCHC Sender-Abort generally needs
   padding bits.

   Padding bits are strictly less than a L2 Word size.  The MIC is at
   least the size of an L2 Word.  Therefore, by looking at the message
   length, a receiver can distinguish a SCHC Sender-Abort from an SCHC
   All-1 ACK REQ (see Section 8.3.3.2), even in the presence of padding.

   The Rule ID and DTag values in the SCHC Sender-Abort message MUST be
   identical to the ones used in the fragments of the SCHC Packet the
   transmission of which is being aborted.

   The SCHC Sender-Abort MUST NOT be acknowledged and MUST NOT be
   retransmitted.

8.3.4.2.  SCHC Receiver-Abort

   When a SCHC Fragment receiver needs to abort an on-going fragmented
   SCHC Packet transmission, it transmits a SCHC Receiver-Abort.  Its

   format is described in Figure 23.  The W field is optional.  Its
   presence is specified by each SCHC F/R mode.

   |-- Receiver-Abort Header --|

   +---- ... ----+-- ... --+---+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Rule ID   |   DTag  | W | 1..1|      1..1     |

             next L2 Word boundary ->|<-- L2 Word -->|


                   Figure 23: SCHC Receiver-Abort format

   Notice that the SCHC Receiver-Abort has the same header as a SCHC ACK
   message.  THe bits that follow the SCHC Receiver-Abort header look
   like a shortened Bitmap set to 1 up to the first L2 Word boundary,
   followed by an extra L2 Word full of 1's.  Such a bit pattern never
   occurs in a regular SCHC ACK.  This is how the SCHC Receiver-Abort
   message is recognized.

   The Rule ID and DTag values in the SCHC Receiver-Abort message MUST
   be identical to the ones used in the fragments of the SCHC Packet the
   transmission of which is being aborted.

   A SCHC Receiver-Abort is aligned to L2 Words, by design.  Therefore,
   padding MUST NOT be appended.

   The SCHC Sender-Abort MUST NOT be acknowledged and MUST NOT be
   retransmitted.

8.4.  SCHC F/R modes

8.4.1.  No-ACK mode

   In No-ACK mode, there is no feedback communication from the fragment
   receiver to the fragment sender.  The sender just transmits all the
   SCHC Fragments blindly.

   SCHC ACK or SCHC ACK REQ MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be ignored if
   received.  SCHC Sender-Abort MAY be sent.  SCHC Receiver-Abort MUST
   NOT be sent.

   Windowing is not used.  Therefore, the W field MUST NOT be present.
   The Retransmission Timer is not used.  One Inactivity Timer MUST be
   instanciated for each pair of Rule Id and optional DTag values.  The
   Inactivity Timer expiration value is based on the characteristics of
   the underlying LPWAN technology and MUST be defined in other
   documents (e.g. technology-specific profile documents).

   The presence and size of the MIC and DTag fields MUST be defined by
   each LPWAN technology-specific document.  The size of the FCN field
   is RECOMMENDED to be 1 bit but MAY be defined by each LPWAN
   technology-specific document.

8.4.1.1.  Sender behaviour

   The sender transmits all the SCHC Fragments of a SCHC Packet, in
   sequential order.  The All-1 FCN value MUST be used for the last SCHC
   Fragment, and MUST NOT be used for the preceeding SCHC Fragments.  If
   it receives a SCHC Receiver-Abort with the corresponding Rule Id and
   optional DTag, the sender MAY abort the on-going transmission and MAY
   release all its state associated to this fragmented SCHC Packet.

   Figure 36 shows an example of a corresponding state machine.

8.4.1.2.  Receiver behaviour

   While FCN is not All-1, the receiver concatenates the payloads of the
   SCHC Fragments that bear the same Rule Id and optional DTag, in the
   order they are received.  When an All-1 SCHC Fragment is received
   with the same Rule Id and optional DTag, the receiver appends the
   All-1 SCHC Fragment Payload and the padding bits to the buffer and
   reassembly concludes.

   Each time a SCHC Fragment is received with the same Rule Id and
   optional DTag, the Inactivity timer MUST be reset.

   When the Inactivity timer expires, the reassembly operation
   concludes.

   If reassembly concludes because of Inactivity Timer expiration, the
   SCHC Packet being reassembled MUST be dropped and resources
   associated with this Rule Id and optional DTag MUST be released.

   If reassembly concludes because of receiving an All-1 SCHC Fragment
   and if integrity checking (either through the MIC or through some
   other L2 means) fails, the reassembled SCHC Packet MUST be dropped
   and resources associated with this Rule Id and optional DTag MUST be
   released.

   On reception of a SCHC Sender-Abort, the receiver MAY release all
   resource related to the reassembly of the SCHC Fragments with the
   same Rule Id and optional DTag.

   Figure 37 shows an example of a corresponding state machine.

8.4.2.  ACK-Always

8.4.3.  ACK-on-Error

8.5.  Supporting multiple window sizes

   For ACK-Always or ACK-on-Error, implementers MAY opt to support a
   single window size or multiple window sizes.  The latter, when
   feasible, may provide performance optimizations.  For example, a
   large window size SHOULD be used for packets that need to be carried
   by a large number of SCHC Fragments.  However, when the number of
   SCHC Fragments required to carry a packet is low, a smaller window
   size, and thus a shorter Bitmap, MAY be sufficient to provide
   feedback on all SCHC Fragments.  If multiple window sizes are
   supported, the Rule ID MAY be used to signal the window size in use
   for a specific packet transmission.

   Note that the same window size MUST be used for the transmission of
   all SCHC Fragments that belong to the same SCHC Packet.

8.6.  Downlink SCHC Fragment transmission

   For downlink transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet in ACK-Always
   mode, the SCHC Fragment receiver MAY support timer-based SCHC ACK
   retransmission.  In this mechanism, the SCHC Fragment receiver
   initializes and starts a timer (the Inactivity Timer is used) after
   the transmission of a SCHC ACK, except when the SCHC ACK is sent in
   response to the last SCHC Fragment of a packet (All-1 fragment).  In
   the latter case, the SCHC Fragment receiver does not start a timer
   after transmission of the SCHC ACK.

   If, after transmission of a SCHC ACK that is not an All-1 fragment,
   and before expiration of the corresponding Inactivity timer, the SCHC
   Fragment receiver receives a SCHC Fragment that belongs to the
   current window (e.g. a missing SCHC Fragment from the current window)
   or to the next window, the Inactivity timer for the SCHC ACK is
   stopped.  However, if the Inactivity timer expires, the SCHC ACK is
   resent and the Inactivity timer is reinitialized and restarted.

   The default initial value for the Inactivity timer, as well as the
   maximum number of retries for a specific SCHC ACK, denoted
   MAX_ACK_RETRIES, are not defined in this document, and need to be
   defined in other documents (e.g. technology-specific profiles).  The
   initial value of the Inactivity timer is expected to be greater than
   that of the Retransmission timer, in order to make sure that a
   (buffered) SCHC Fragment to be retransmitted can find an opportunity
   for that transmission.

   When the SCHC Fragment sender transmits the All-1 fragment, it starts
   its Retransmission Timer with a large timeout value (e.g. several
   times that of the initial Inactivity timer).  If a SCHC ACK is
   received before expiration of this timer, the SCHC Fragment sender
   retransmits any lost SCHC Fragments reported by the SCHC ACK, or if
   the SCHC ACK confirms successful reception of all SCHC Fragments of
   the last window, the transmission of the fragmented SCHC Packet is
   considered complete.  If the timer expires, and no SCHC ACK has been
   received since the start of the timer, the SCHC Fragment sender
   assumes that the All-1 fragment has been successfully received (and
   possibly, the last SCHC ACK has been lost: this mechanism assumes
   that the retransmission timer for the All-1 fragment is long enough
   to allow several SCHC ACK retries if the All-1 fragment has not;been
   received by the SCHC Fragment receiver, and it also assumes that it
   is unlikely that several ACKs become all lost).

9.  Padding management

   SCHC C/D and SCHC F/R operate on bits, not bytes.  SCHC itself does
   not have any alignment prerequisite.  If the L2 below SCHC constrains
   the payload to align to some boundary, called L2 Words (for example,
   bytes), SCHC will meet that constraint and produce messages with the
   correct alignement.  This may entail adding extra bits (called
   padding bits).

   When padding occurs, the number of appended bits is strictly less
   than the L2 Word size.

   Padding happens at most once for each Packet during SCHC Compression
   and optional SCHC Fragmentation (see Figure 2).  If a SCHC Packet is
   sent unfragmented (see Figure 24), it is padded as needed.  If a SCHC
   Packet is fragmented, only the last fragment is padded as needed.

10.  SCHC Compression for IPv6 and UDP headers

   This section lists the different IPv6 and UDP header fields and how
   they can be compressed.

10.1.  IPv6 version field

   This field always holds the same value.  Therefore, in the Rule, TV
   is set to 6, MO to "equal" and CDA to "not-sent".

10.2.  IPv6 Traffic class field

   If the DiffServ field does not vary and is known by both sides, the
   Field Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this well-known
   value, an "equal" MO and a "not-sent" CDA.

   Otherwise (e.g.  ECN bits are to be transmitted), two possibilities
   can be considered depending on the variability of the value:

   o  One possibility is to not compress the field and send the original
      value.  In the Rule, TV is not set to any particular value, MO is
      set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   o  If some upper bits in the field are constant and known, a better
      option is to only send the LSBs.  In the Rule, TV is set to a
      value with the stable known upper part, MO is set to MSB(x) and
      CDA to LSB(y).

10.3.  Flow label field

   If the Flow Label field does not vary and is known by both sides, the
   Field Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this well-known
   value, an "equal" MO and a "not-sent" CDA.

   Otherwise, two possibilities can be considered:

   o  One possibility is to not compress the field and send the original
      value.  In the Rule, TV is not set to any particular value, MO is
      set to "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".

   o  If some upper bits in the field are constant and known, a better
      option is to only send the LSBs.  In the Rule, TV is set to a
      value with the stable known upper part, MO is set to MSB(x) and
      CDA to LSB(y).

10.4.  Payload Length field

   This field can be elided for the transmission on the LPWAN network.
   The SCHC C/D recomputes the original payload length value.  In the
   Field Descriptor, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore" and CDA is
   "compute-IPv6-length".

   If the payload length needs to be sent and does not need to be coded
   in 16 bits, the TV can be set to 0x0000, the MO set to MSB(16-s)
   where 's' is the number of bits to code the maximum length, and CDA
   is set to LSB(s).

10.5.  Next Header field

   If the Next Header field does not vary and is known by both sides,
   the Field Descriptor in the Rule SHOULD contain a TV with this Next
   Header value, the MO SHOULD be "equal" and the CDA SHOULD be "not-
   sent".

   Otherwise, TV is not set in the Field Descriptor, MO is set to
   "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".  Alternatively, a matching-
   list MAY also be used.

10.6.  Hop Limit field

   The field behavior for this field is different for Uplink and
   Downlink.  In Uplink, since there is no IP forwarding between the Dev
   and the SCHC C/D, the value is relatively constant.  On the other
   hand, the Downlink value depends of Internet routing and MAY change
   more frequently.  One neat way of processing this field is to use the
   Direction Indicator (DI) to distinguish both directions:

   o  in the Uplink, elide the field: the TV in the Field Descriptor is
      set to the known constant value, the MO is set to "equal" and the
      CDA is set to "not-sent".

   o  in the Downlink, send the value: TV is not set, MO is set to
      "ignore" and CDA is set to "value-sent".

10.7.  IPv6 addresses fields

   As in 6LoWPAN [RFC4944], IPv6 addresses are split into two 64-bit
   long fields; one for the prefix and one for the Interface Identifier
   (IID).  These fields SHOULD be compressed.  To allow for a single
   Rule being used for both directions, these values are identified by
   their role (DEV or APP) and not by their position in the header
   (source or destination).

10.7.1.  IPv6 source and destination prefixes

   Both ends MUST be synchronized with the appropriate prefixes.  For a
   specific flow, the source and destination prefixes can be unique and
   stored in the context.  It can be either a link-local prefix or a
   global prefix.  In that case, the TV for the source and destination
   prefixes contain the values, the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA is
   set to "not-sent".

   If the Rule is intended to compress packets with different prefix
   values, match-mapping SHOULD be used.  The different prefixes are
   listed in the TV, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set
   to "mapping-sent".  See Figure 26

   Otherwise, the TV contains the prefix, the MO is set to "equal" and
   the CDA is set to "value-sent".

10.7.2.  IPv6 source and destination IID

   If the DEV or APP IID are based on an LPWAN address, then the IID can
   be reconstructed with information coming from the LPWAN header.  In
   that case, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA
   is set to "DevIID" or "AppIID".  Note that the LPWAN technology
   generally carries a single identifier corresponding to the DEV.
   Therefore AppIID cannot be used.

   For privacy reasons or if the DEV address is changing over time, a
   static value that is not equal to the DEV address SHOULD be used.  In
   that case, the TV contains the static value, the MO operator is set
   to "equal" and the CDF is set to "not-sent".  [RFC7217] provides some
   methods that MAY be used to derive this static identifier.

   If several IIDs are possible, then the TV contains the list of
   possible IIDs, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to
   "mapping-sent".

   It MAY also happen that the IID variability only expresses itself on
   a few bytes.  In that case, the TV is set to the stable part of the
   IID, the MO is set to "MSB" and the CDA is set to "LSB".

   Finally, the IID can be sent in extenso on the LPWAN.  In that case,
   the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to
   "value-sent".

10.8.  IPv6 extensions

   No Rule is currently defined that processes IPv6 extensions.  If such
   extensions are needed, their compression/decompression Rules can be
   based on the MOs and CDAs described above.

10.9.  UDP source and destination port

   To allow for a single Rule being used for both directions, the UDP
   port values are identified by their role (DEV or APP) and not by
   their position in the header (source or destination).  The SCHC C/D
   MUST be aware of the traffic direction (Uplink, Downlink) to select
   the appropriate field.  The following Rules apply for DEV and APP
   port numbers.

   If both ends know the port number, it can be elided.  The TV contains
   the port number, the MO is set to "equal" and the CDA is set to "not-
   sent".

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   If the port variation is on few bits, the TV contains the stable part
   of the port number, the MO is set to "MSB" and the CDA is set to
   "LSB".

   If some well-known values are used, the TV can contain the list of
   these values, the MO is set to "match-mapping" and the CDA is set to
   "mapping-sent".

   Otherwise the port numbers are sent over the LPWAN.  The TV is not
   set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-sent".

10.10.  UDP length field

   The UDP length can be computed from the received data.  In that case,
   the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to
   "compute-length".

   If the payload is small, the TV can be set to 0x0000, the MO set to
   "MSB" and the CDA to "LSB".

   In other cases, the length SHOULD be sent and the CDA is replaced by
   "value-sent".

10.11.  UDP Checksum field

   The UDP checksum operation is mandatory with IPv6 [RFC8200] for most
   packets but recognizes that there are exceptions to that default
   behavior.

   For instance, protocols that use UDP as a tunnel encapsulation may
   enable zero-checksum mode for a specific port (or set of ports) for
   sending and/or receiving.  [RFC8200] also stipulates that any node
   implementing zero-checksum mode must follow the requirements
   specified in "Applicability Statement for the Use of IPv6 UDP
   Datagrams with Zero Checksums" [RFC6936].

   6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282] also authorizes to send UDP
   datagram that are deprived of the checksum protection when an upper
   layer guarantees the integrity of the UDP payload and pseudo-header
   all the way between the compressor that elides the UDP checksum and
   the decompressor that computes again it.  A specific example of this
   is when a Message Integrity Check (MIC) protects the compressed
   message all along that path with a strength that is identical or
   better to the UDP checksum.

   In a similar fashion, this specification allows a SCHC compressor to
   elide the UDP checks when another layer guarantees an identical or
   better integrity protection for the UDP payload and the pseudo-

   header.  In this case, the TV is not set, the MO is set to "ignore"
   and the CDA is set to "compute-checksum".

   In particular, when SCHC fragmentation is used, a fragmentation MIC
   of 2 bytes or more provides equal or better protection than the UDP
   checksum; in that case, if the compressor is collocated with the
   fragmentation point and the decompressor is collocated with the
   packet reassembly point, then compressor MAY elide the UDP checksum.
   Whether and when the UDP Checksum is elided is to be specified in the
   technology-specific documents.

   Since the compression happens before the fragmentation, implementors
   should understand the risks when dealing with unprotected data below
   the transport layer and take special care when manipulating that
   data.

   In other cases, the checksum SHOULD be explicitly sent.  The TV is
   not set, the MO is set to "ignore" and the CDA is set to "value-
   sent".

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request to IANA.

12.  Security considerations

12.1.  Security considerations for SCHC Compression/Decompression

   A malicious header compression could cause the reconstruction of a
   wrong packet that does not match with the original one.  Such a
   corruption MAY be detected with end-to-end authentication and
   integrity mechanisms.  Header Compression does not add more security
   problem than what is already needed in a transmission.  For instance,
   to avoid an attack, never re-construct a packet bigger than some
   configured size (with 1500 bytes as generic default).

12.2.  Security considerations for SCHC Fragmentation/Reassembly

   This subsection describes potential attacks to LPWAN SCHC F/R and
   suggests possible countermeasures.

   A node can perform a buffer reservation attack by sending a first
   SCHC Fragment to a target.  Then, the receiver will reserve buffer
   space for the IPv6 packet.  Other incoming fragmented SCHC Packets
   will be dropped while the reassembly buffer is occupied during the
   reassembly timeout.  Once that timeout expires, the attacker can
   repeat the same procedure, and iterate, thus creating a denial of
   service attack.  The (low) cost to mount this attack is linear with



Minaburo, et al.         Expires March 16, 2019                [Page 41]

Internet-Draft                 LPWAN SCHC                 September 2018


   the number of buffers at the target node.  However, the cost for an
   attacker can be increased if individual SCHC Fragments of multiple
   packets can be stored in the reassembly buffer.  To further increase
   the attack cost, the reassembly buffer can be split into SCHC
   Fragment-sized buffer slots.  Once a packet is complete, it is
   processed normally.  If buffer overload occurs, a receiver can
   discard packets based on the sender behavior, which MAY help identify
   which SCHC Fragments have been sent by an attacker.

   In another type of attack, the malicious node is required to have
   overhearing capabilities.  If an attacker can overhear a SCHC
   Fragment, it can send a spoofed duplicate (e.g. with random payload)
   to the destination.  If the LPWAN technology does not support
   suitable protection (e.g. source authentication and frame counters to
   prevent replay attacks), a receiver cannot distinguish legitimate
   from spoofed SCHC Fragments.  Therefore, the original IPv6 packet
   will be considered corrupt and will be dropped.  To protect resource-
   constrained nodes from this attack, it has been proposed to establish
   a binding among the SCHC Fragments to be transmitted by a node, by
   applying content-chaining to the different SCHC Fragments, based on
   cryptographic hash functionality.  The aim of this technique is to
   allow a receiver to identify illegitimate SCHC Fragments.

   Further attacks MAY involve sending overlapped fragments (i.e.
   comprising some overlapping parts of the original IPv6 datagram).
   Implementers SHOULD make sure that the correct operation is not
   affected by such event.

   In ACK-on-Error, a malicious node MAY force a SCHC Fragment sender to
   resend a SCHC Fragment a number of times, with the aim to increase
   consumption of the SCHC Fragment sender's resources.  To this end,
   the malicious node MAY repeatedly send a fake ACK to the SCHC
   Fragment sender, with a Bitmap that reports that one or more SCHC
   Fragments have been lost.  In order to mitigate this possible attack,
   MAX_ACK_RETRIES MAY be set to a safe value which allows to limit the
   maximum damage of the attack to an acceptable extent.  However, note
   that a high setting for MAX_ACK_RETRIES benefits SCHC Fragment
   reliability modes, therefore the trade-off needs to be carefully
   considered.

Appendix A.  SCHC Compression Examples

   This section gives some scenarios of the compression mechanism for
   IPv6/UDP.  The goal is to illustrate the behavior of SCHC.

   The most common case using the mechanisms defined in this document
   will be a LPWAN Dev that embeds some applications running over CoAP.
   In this example, three flows are considered.  The first flow is for
   the device management based on CoAP using Link Local IPv6 addresses
   and UDP ports 123 and 124 for Dev and App, respectively.  The second
   flow will be a CoAP server for measurements done by the Device (using
   ports 5683) and Global IPv6 Address prefixes alpha::IID/64 to
   beta::1/64.  The last flow is for legacy applications using different
   ports numbers, the destination IPv6 address prefix is gamma::1/64.

   Figure 25 presents the protocol stack for this Device.  IPv6 and UDP
   are represented with dotted lines since these protocols are
   compressed on the radio link.

   Note that in some LPWAN technologies, only the Devs have a device ID.
   Therefore, when such technologies are used, it is necessary to
   statically define an IID for the Link Local address for the SCHC C/D.

   All the fields described in the three Rules depicted on Figure 26 are
   present in the IPv6 and UDP headers.  The DevIID-DID value is found
   in the L2 header.

   The second and third Rules use global addresses.  The way the Dev
   learns the prefix is not in the scope of the document.

   The third Rule compresses port numbers to 4 bits.

Appendix B.  Fragmentation Examples

   This section provides examples for the different fragment reliability
   modes specified in this document.

   Figure 27 illustrates the transmission in No-ACK mode of an IPv6
   packet that needs 11 fragments.  FCN is 1 bit wide.

    Figure 27: Transmission in No-ACK mode of an IPv6 packet carried by
                               11 fragments

   In the following examples, N (i.e. the size if the FCN field) is 3
   bits.  Therefore, the All-1 FCN value is 7.

   Figure 28 illustrates the transmission in ACK-on-Error of an IPv6
   packet that needs 11 fragments, with MAX_WIND_FCN=6 and no fragment
   loss.

        Figure 41: Receiver State Machine for the ACK-on-Error Mode

Appendix D.  SCHC Parameters

   This section lists the parameters that need to be defined in the
   LPWAN technology-specific documents.

   o  Most common uses cases, deployment scenarios

   o  Mapping of the SCHC architectural elements onto the LPWAN
      architecture

   o  Assessment of LPWAN integrity checking

   o  Various potential channel conditions for the technology and the
      corresponding recommended use of SCHC C/D and F/R

   o  Rule ID numbering scheme, fixed-sized or variable-sized Rule IDs,
      number of Rules, the way the Rule ID is transmitted

   o  Padding: size of the L2 Word (for most LPWAN technologies, this
      would be a byte; for some technologies, a bit)

   o  Decision to use SCHC fragmentation mechanism or not.  If yes:

      *  reliability mode(s) used, in which cases (e.g. based on link
         channel condition)

      *  number of bits for FCN (N), for W (M) and for DTag (T)

      *  support for interleaved packet transmission, to what extent

      *  size of MIC and algorithm for its computation, if different
         from the default CRC32.  Byte fill-up with zeroes or other
         mechanism, to be specified.

      *  Retransmission Timer duration

      *  Inactivity Timer duration

      *  MAX_ACK_REQUEST value

   o  if L2 Word is wider than a bit and SCHC fragmentation is used,
      value of the padding bits (0 or 1).  This is needed because the
      padding bits of the last fragment are included in the MIC
      conputation.

   o  Note on the "C-bit bump": When fragmenting in ACK-on-Error or ACK-
      Always mode, it is expected that the last window (called All-1
      window) will not be fully utilised, i.e. there won't be fragments
      with all FCN values from MAX_WIND_FCN downto 1 and finally All-1.
      It is worth noting that this document does not mandate that other
      windows (called All-0 windows) are fully utilised either.  This
      document purposely does not specify that All-1 windows use Bitmaps
      with the same number of bits as All-0 windows do.  By default,
      Bitmaps for All-0 and All-1 windows are of the same size
      MAX_WIND_FCN + 1.  But a technology-specific document MAY revert
      that decision.  The rationale for reverting the decision could be
      the following: Note that the SCHC ACK sent as a response to an
      All-1 fragment includes a C bit that SCHC ACK for other windows
      don't have.  Therefore, the SCHC ACK for the All-1 window is one
      bit bigger.  An LPWAN technology with a severely constrained
      payload size might decide that this "bump" in the SCHC ACK for the
      last fragment is a bad resource usage.  It could thus mandate that
      the All-1 window is not allowed to use the FCN value 1 and that
      the All-1 SCHC ACK Bitmap size is reduced by 1 bit.  This provides
      room for the C bit without creating a bump in the SCHC ACK.

   o  Note on soliciting downlink transmissions: In some LPWAN
      technologies, as part of energy-saving techniques, downlink
      transmission is only possible immediately after an uplink
      transmission.  In order to avoid potentially high delay in the
      downlink transmission of a fragmented SCHC Packet, the SCHC
      Fragment receiver may want to perform an uplink transmission as
      soon as possible after reception of a SCHC Fragment that is not
      the last one.  Such uplink transmission may be triggered by the L2
      (e.g. an L2 ACK sent in response to a SCHC Fragment encapsulated
      in a L2 PDU that requires an L2 ACK) or it may be triggered from
      an upper layer.

   o  the following parameters need to be addressed in documents other
      than this one but not forcely in the LPWAN technology-specific
      documents:

      *  The way the contexts are provisioned

      *  The way the Rules as generated
